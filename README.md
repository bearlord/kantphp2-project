## Introducing Kantphp2
> Kantphp2 Framework is an combination of **Yii2** and **Laravel5.2-4**. It's imitated by 50% of Yii2's codes and 30% of Laravel's codes. Yes! It's imitated, not original.
>
> The licence of Yii2 is **BSD** and the licence of Laravel is **MIT**. So Kantphp2 imitates them for better programming.

### How does Kantphp imitate Yii2 and Laravel Frameworks?
> Kantphp2 imitates Yii's Components, DI, Model, Active record, Controller, Action, Behavior, View, Grid View, Widgets, Helpers, excluding Request, Response, Cookie, Session, Router and Urlmanager.

> Kantphp2 imitates Laravel's DI, Router, Helpers, Request, Response, Cookie, and Session.
>
> So Kantphp can achieve implicit Route in backend[admin] module, and explicit route in frontend[user] module to hide unsafe APIs.
